> TL;DR: this repository is not maintained for any new development. I plan to

> My circumstances changed since I started the GitHub Action in 2020. I am not

>
> The action is 175 lines of shell script. Feel free to fork it and modify it
> for your own use case.

> If you create a fork that might replace this one, I will add a note in the
> documentation and the README.md. Please, open an issue and I will do it.


Suggestion: read carefully the GitHub Action output. It might contain information that might help fixing the problem. If not please keep opening the bug report.

The [documentation](https://github.com/cpina/push-to-another-repository-docs)
might have information on what you could do to fix the problem. See the [FAQ](https://cpina.github.io/push-to-another-repository-docs/faq.html)

<!--
**Copy-paste the output of the GitHub Action**

Full output might contain useful information including the git command, git output and settings used. It also helps to search for the problem later on.

**URL to the execution**

Paste the URL of the execution where it's possible to see the problem. This will help me to see the configuration and the output in more context.
