> [!WARNING]
> TL;DR: this repository is not maintained for any new development. I plan to
> fix issues if they arise due to changes on GitHub, to minimise disruption of
> existing usage.
>
> My circumstances changed since I started the GitHub Action in 2020. I am not
> able to add functionality to it or fix issues.
>
> The action is 175 lines of shell script. Feel free to fork it and modify it
> for your own use case.
>
> If you create a fork that might replace this one, I will add a note in the
> documentation and the README.md. Please, open an issue and I will do it.
