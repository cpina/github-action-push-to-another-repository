# github-action-push-branch-to-another-repository-branch

Used to push generated files from a branch from Git Action step into a branch in another repository on Github. By design it deletes the files from the destination branch as it is meant to "publish" a set generated files.

Basically, after running this action, the contents of the destination branch will be the same as the contents of the source branch.

**Note:** Both source and destination branch must exists. This action does not create the destination branch if it doesn't exists.
**Note:** The new commit will override the entire content of the destination branch with the source branch in a new commit. It does not override the history in destination branch.

## Inputs
### `source-directory` (argument)
From the repository that this Git Action is executed the directory that contains the files to be pushed into the repository.

### `destination-github-username` (argument)
For the repository `https://github.com/cpina/push-to-another-repository-output` is `cpina`. It's also used for the `Author:` in the generated git messages.

### `destination-repository-name` (argument)
For the repository `https://github.com/cpina/push-to-another-repository-output` is `push-to-another-repository-output`

*Warning:* this Github Action currently deletes all the files and directories in the destination repository. The idea is to copy from an `output` directory into the `destination-repository-name` having a copy without any previous files there.

### `user-email` (argument)
The email that will be used for the commit in the destination-repository-name.

### `destination-repository-username` (argument) [optional]
The Username/Organization for the destination repository, if different from `destination-github-username`. For the repository `https://github.com/cpina/push-to-another-repository-output` is `cpina`.

### `target-branch` (argument) [optional]
The branch name for the destination repository, if different from `master`.

### `commit-message` (argument) [optional]
The commit message to be used in the output repository. Optional and defaults to "Update from $REPOSITORY_URL@commit".

The string `ORIGIN_COMMIT` is replaced by `$REPOSITORY_URL@commit`.

### `API_TOKEN_GITHUB` (environment)
E.g.:
  `API_TOKEN_GITHUB: ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN_GITHUB }}`

Generate your personal token following the steps:
* Go to the Github Settings (on the right hand side on the profile picture)
* On the left hand side pane click on "Developer Settings"
* Click on "Personal Access Tokens" (also available at https://github.com/settings/tokens)
* Generate a new token, choose "Repo". Copy the token.

Then make the token available to the Github Action following the steps:
* Go to the Github page for the repository that you push from, click on "Settings"
* On the left hand side pane click on "Secrets"
* Click on "Add a new secret" and name it "API_TOKEN_GITHUB"

## Example usage
```yaml
      - name: Pushes to another repository
        uses: cpina/github-action-push-to-another-repository@master
        env:
          API_TOKEN_GITHUB: ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN_GITHUB }}
        with:
          source-directory: 'output'
          destination-github-username: 'cpina'
          destination-repository-name: 'pandoc-test-output'
          user-email: carles3@pina.cat
